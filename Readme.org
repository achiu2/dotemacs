* My Emacs configuration

Here's my emacs configuration. 

** Some of the things I use emacs for:
- Python coding
- Web development
- Java and processing (mostly for teaching APC)
- latex
- All sorts of org-mode stuff
  - lesson planning
  - blogging 
  - managing my schedules, notes, bookmarks etc.
** Piecemeal install 
- make sure you've updated your list of packages with 
  **M-x package-refresh-contents** and then grab chunks of
  this configuration and integrate it into your own.

** Full install
- I'm assuming that you have nothing in your .emacs.d directory
- Remove the .emacs file from your home directory (if you have a .emacs file)
- clone this and rename the directory .emacs.d
  git clone https://github.com/zamansky/dotemacs.git .emacs.d
