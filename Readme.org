* My Emacs configuration

Here's my emacs configuration. 

** Some of the things I use emacs for:
- Python coding
- Web development
- Java and processing (mostly for teaching APC)
- latex
- All sorts of org-mode stuff
  - lesson planning
  - blogging 
  - managing my schedules, notes, bookmarks etc.
** Piecemeal install 
- make sure you've updated your list of packages with 
  **M-x package-refresh-contents** and then grab chunks of
  this configuration and integrate it into your own.
** Full install
- get rid of your .emacs.d directory if you have one (**mv .emacs.d
  dot-emacs.d-bak** or something like that if you want to save it).
- Remove the .emacs file from your home directory (if you have a
  .emacs file)
- clone this and rename the directory .emacs.d
  git clone https://github.com/zamansky/dotemacs.git .emacs.d
- load emacs and run **M-x package-refresh-contents**. You'll want to
  run this command whenever you update the package sources in init.el
- quit emacs
- load emacs again
- that should be it
** Commenting out sections
You can comment out some of the emacs-lisp blocks by adding **:tangle
no** to the end of the begin_src lines
